# Code Style and Structure
- Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; avoid options API.

- Use Css Modules,Sass and Tailwind for styling.
- The backend administration project uses @mihoyo-fe/mihoyo-ui as a component library, which is an alias for ElementUI, el-button => mi-button

# Key Conventions

- Use VueUse(Version ^11 for Vue 2.7) for common composables and utility functions.
- Use @tanstack/vue-query for data fetching.

# Vue 2 and Composition API Best Practices

- Leverage ref, and computed for reactive state management.
